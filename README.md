masterSearch
=========

A scraper that takes a keyword, searches a portal of master's courses and returns them with fees and university ranks.

FAQ: Why is the code so slow? 
Ans. Because it sucks, that's why.
FAQ: If it sucks, why did you upload it? 
And. I made it as a hobby project for personal use. I am only uploading it on demand on Quora.

Use "pip install BeautifulSoup" to meet the dependency. Internet Connection is required to run this code. It will not work after some time, if there are too many courses to process because I had used an unofficial implementation of Google API.

Please help improve this hugely outdated and unmaintained code. And if you do it personally (without using "fork"), I hope you share the link with me at abhijit [dot] 148 [at] gmail [dot] com .
